# Pistonsim - Demo

A logic simulation game inspired by Minecraft's redstone. Because why not?!

Although this is just a demo version. The main version has it's own respository, and I will continue the development there.

To compile this version, just use the Makefile:
```shell
$ make
```
Bruh.

Only works on laptops with Unix btw. Can't be bothered to make it cross-platform in the demo. Good luck.
